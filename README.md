## Description
PhaseFlux is a Streamlit-based web application that predicts flow regimes in multiphase flow systems under adiabatic conditions. It utilizes a LightGBM model to provide predictions based on various input parameters related to fluid properties and flow conditions. The app also offers feature importance analysis using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values.

## Important Note
This app is for demonstration purposes only and should not be used for real-world applications. The predictions should be validated against experimental data or established correlations for critical applications.

## Features
- Instant flow regime predictions based on user-input parameters
- Advanced feature contribution analysis using SHAP values

## Local Installation

If you prefer to run PhaseFlux locally, you have two options:

### Option 1: Using Docker (Recommended)

#### Prerequisites
- Docker
- Docker Compose

#### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/benettia/phaseflux.git
   cd phaseflux
   ```

2. Build and run the Docker container:
   ```
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. Access the application at:
   ```
   http://localhost:8501

### Option 2: Using Virtual Environment

#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- pip

#### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/benettia/phaseflux.git
   cd phaseflux
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the Streamlit app:
